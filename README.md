# SelecTron
Chrome extension that allows a user to automatically copy and run a google search for the selected text. Additional options and features include: 

* Copy to clipboard only when block of text is selected.
* Search only when block of text is selected.
* Both copy to clipboard and search when block of text is selected.
* Or Show a neat popup for each select option.

# Why create another tool?
To learn. This is my first chrome extension, so the sole purpose of this is to build a tool with customizations suited for my browsing needs with one philosophy in mind - *learn by doing*.

I would definitely love for this to be used by people other than me. And very much encourage any feedback/comments on the same.
